# About Me

👾 **Aspiring Web Developer**  
I haven’t officially started my journey as a web developer yet, but I’m passionate about all things web! I spend my time experimenting with HTML and CSS, and I have a growing curiosity for all the amazing things AI can do.

🎮 **Featured Project**  
Check out my pride and joy: [Fidgetland Minigames and More](https://fidgetboyrolly.github.io/fidgetland-minigames-and-more/)  
It’s a collection of fun minigames—perfect for anyone who wants to procrastinate productively!

🕵️ **The Mystery Coder**  
My real name? That’s top secret. Some mysteries are better left unsolved. (It makes me sound cooler, right?)

🤖 **AI Enthusiast**  
I might not have built a robot army (yet), but I’m fascinated by AI technologies and how they’re changing the world (also, they don’t ask for my real name).

😜 **Why Ask for My GitHub?**  
You found me on Github already Isn’t that enough detective work for one day?

😂 **insanity level: not that high**  
expect a funny theme and lots of quirky surprises in everything I make! Even check consoles
